# Project Context

## About This Project

A learning resource for GitHub Copilot CLI - needs updating for the NEW agentic tool.

## Critical Knowledge

**Read this first:** [docs/copilot-cli-research.md](docs/copilot-cli-research.md)

Key points:
- The `copilot` command is a NEW agentic CLI (very similar to Claude Code)
- The old `gh copilot` extension was **deprecated October 2025**
- Current project content is outdated (written for old `gh copilot`)

## What Needs Updating

All sections need revision for the NEW `copilot` tool:

1. **README.md** - New description and installation
2. **01-getting-started/** - `copilot` command, not `gh copilot`
3. **02-suggest-command/** - Now conversational, not one-shot
4. **03-explain-command/** - Works differently now
5. **04-shell-integration/** - New slash commands (`/model`, `/mcp`, etc.)
6. **05-aliases-shortcuts/** - May need revision
7. **06-workflows/** - Update for agentic capabilities
8. **07-advanced/** - MCP servers, custom agents, `/delegate`
9. **08-best-practices/** - Still relevant
10. **CLAUDE-CODE-COMPARISON.md** - Major revision (tools are now very similar!)
