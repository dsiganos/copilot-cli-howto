A comprehensive learning resource for mastering **GitHub Copilot CLI** - an agentic AI assistant that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your terminal.

## What is GitHub Copilot CLI?

GitHub Copilot CLI is a **conversational AI assistant** that runs in your terminal. Unlike simple command suggestion tools, it's an agentic assistant that can:

- **Edit files directly** in your codebase
- **Run commands** and analyze their output
- **Maintain conversation context** across sessions
- **Integrate with GitHub** (issues, PRs, repositories)
- **Extend via MCP** (Model Context Protocol) servers

It's powered by the same agentic technology as GitHub's Copilot coding agent, with **Claude Sonnet 4.5** as the default model.

> **Note:** This is NOT the deprecated `gh copilot` extension. That tool was deprecated in October 2025 in favor of this new agentic CLI.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# macOS/Linux (Homebrew)
brew install copilot-cli

# macOS/Linux/Windows (npm)
npm install -g @github/copilot

# Windows (winget)
winget install GitHub.Copilot

# Universal (shell script)
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

### First Run

```bash
# Start interactive mode
copilot

# Or with a prompt
copilot -p "explain this codebase"
```

On first launch, you'll be prompted to authenticate with GitHub and trust the current directory.

## Key Features

### Conversational Interface

```bash
$ copilot
> What does this project do?

Copilot analyzes your codebase and responds...

> Can you add input validation to the login function?

Copilot edits the file and shows you the changes...

> Now write tests for it

Copilot creates test files...
```

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | Select AI model (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, etc.) |
| `/delegate` | Hand off task to GitHub's cloud agent |
| `/mcp add` | Add MCP server for extended capabilities |
| `/agent` | Select from custom agents |
| `/cwd` | Change working directory |
| `/usage` | View session statistics |
| `?` | Show all commands |

### Special Syntax

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `@filepath` | Reference a specific file |
| `!command` | Run shell command directly (bypass AI) |
| `Esc` | Cancel current operation |

### Session Persistence

```bash
# Resume your last session
copilot --resume

# Continue with context
copilot --continue
```

## Comparison with Claude Code

GitHub Copilot CLI and Claude Code are now very similar tools. See our detailed comparison:

**[📊 Claude Code vs GitHub Copilot CLI](./CLAUDE-CODE-COMPARISON.md)**

Key differences:
- Copilot CLI integrates deeply with GitHub (issues, PRs, /delegate)
- Claude Code has more sophisticated planning capabilities
- Different pricing models (Copilot subscription vs Claude API)
- Both support MCP, file editing, command execution, and sessions
